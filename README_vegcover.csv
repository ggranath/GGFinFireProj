FILE NAME = Granathetal_vegcover.csv,
Location,"WGS84: 63.166667, 30.666667"
Biome,boreal
Sampling date,"2000, 2003, 20011"
Experimental design,Factorial (fire x retention) with 3 replicates. Microhabitat sampling is paired (plot) and nested in treatment. Groups of trees (type) nested in treatment retention. 
Treatment size,3-4 ha
Sampling method,2 x 2 m frame
Nomenclature,"vascular plants = Karlsson 1998, bryophytes = Hallingbäck et al. 2006, lichens = Santesson et al. 2004"
