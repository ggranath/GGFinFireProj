Location,"WGS84: 63.166667, 30.666667"
Biome,boreal
Sampling date,mid-July 2012
Experimental design,Factorial (fire x retention) with 3 replicates. Microhabitat sampling is paired (plot) and nested in treatment. Groups of trees (type) nested in treatment retention.

Column name,Description
site,experiment site id
fire,"pre-scribed fire treatment (yes = burned, no = unburned)"
retention,"retention level treatment (no = logged, 0% of the pre-harvest tree volume retained; elev = elevated retention, 17.4% retained, ~50 m3 ha-1; full = unlogged, i.e.100% retained)"
transect,"transect within plot or if sub-plots where sampled within retention group (gr) , north of retention group (N) or south of retention group (S) "
type,type of treatment (open = logged (clearcut or logged in elevated retention); gr = group of trees (full retention or within elevated retention)    
plot,Sub-plot (paired tree â€“ flat area sampling) within each replicate (i.e. site)
micro_hab,"Microhabitat (N = north of tree/stump, S = south of tree/stump, P = flat ground)"
